# TrainTime

## Train Scheduler built with Firebase

An immersive train scheduling app built with Firebase non-Sql database, jQuery and Bootstrap that features a gossamer-like responsive interface, engaging rotating background images and real locomotive sound effects. Enjoy the ride.

### How to Use

    >Enter a new Train name & destination. Add the time that your first train will arrive and how often (the trains frequency of arrival) in minutes. The scheduler uses moment.js to calculate how long until, and at what time the next train will arrive based on the current time (moment.js), the original departure time and frequecy entered.
